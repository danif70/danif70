#### Hi! 👋 Hello! I´m Daniela, a Front-End Developer passionate about Education and self-learning. 

I know JavaScript, React, HTML y CSS. I also have knowledge of Python and Node.js.  👩🏻‍💻.
 
 It all started in 2020 (Pandemic, remember 😬?). At first, I took many courses at **Platzi** and, while I was learning a lot of logic and programming languages, I also became part of a wonderful and supportive community💚. 
 Now,I'm in a Web Development Bootcamp at **Laboratoria** where I share with awesome women who, like me, want to be better and productive professionals💛.
 
 I can say that my first love was Python but now I'm in a stable and healthy relationship with JavaScript/HTML/CSS 😁
 
 Did I mention that I have 3 sons and a husband? And a kitty🐱‍👤 and a doggy🐶 too? 😍
