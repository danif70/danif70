#### Hi! 👋 I'm Daniela Funes, I'm Venezuelan and I live in Bogotá, Colombia. 
 I'm passionate about learning and now, in my 50s, I'm learning to code 👩🏻‍💻.
 
 It all started in 2020 (Pandemic, remember 😬?). At first, I took many courses at **Platzi** and, while I was learning a lot of logic and programming languages, I also became part of a wonderful and supportive community💚. 
 Now,I'm in a Web Development Bootcamp at **Laboratoria** where I share with awesome women who, like me, want to be better and productive professionals💛.
 
 I can say that my first love was Python but now I'm in a stable and healthy relationship with JavaScript/HTML/CSS 😁
 
 Did I mention that I have 3 sons and a husband? And a kitty🐱‍👤 and a doggy🐶 too? 😍
